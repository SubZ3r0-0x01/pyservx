--- Progress Log (as of 2025-07-25) ---

**Key Features Implemented:**
- QR code generation for server access.
- Removal of file size restrictions for uploads.
- Functionality for uploading multiple files.
- Automatic generation of `robots.txt` for privacy.
- Enhanced web interface with search and sorting capabilities, and a modern, responsive UI.
- Real-time GUI progress bar for uploads and downloads (ETA, speed, size).
- CLI progress summaries for file transfers.

**Code Refactoring:**
- `server.py` has been modularized into:
    - `pyservx/request_handler.py` (HTTP request handling)
    - `pyservx/html_generator.py` (HTML content generation)
    - `pyservx/file_operations.py` (file-related operations)

**Dependency Management:**
- `qrcode` library added and integrated.
- `build` and `twine` installed for package distribution.

**Project Updates:**
- `README.md` updated with all new features and usage instructions.
- `pyproject.toml` updated for correct package building and dependency management.
- `.gitignore` updated to include new files and directories.

**Deployment Status:**
- Local Git repository committed with all changes.
- Distribution packages (`.whl` and `.tar.gz`) successfully built.
- Packages (`pyservx` versions 1.0.4 and 1.1.0) successfully uploaded to PyPI.
- Attempted to push to GitHub, but encountered a credential issue (Git could not read username). This needs to be resolved before pushing to the remote repository.

**Next Steps (Tomorrow):**
- Resolve GitHub push credential issue.
- Create shell (`.sh`) and batch (`.bat`) scripts for automated GitHub push and PyPI release.
